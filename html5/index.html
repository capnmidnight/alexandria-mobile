                        Alexandria Mobile is a simple app for community notifications. Data aggregation + self-service reporting, hidden behind a simple UI. Code is a lever! Move the world!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        City of Alexandria has a lot of ideas for mobile apps that could be developed and deployed to citizens both for the sake of keeping citizens informed and for collecting information from the people to help inform the city's services. Developing a wide variety of applications separately from each other is inefficient in both time and monetary resources. This project seeks to establish a template--based on a simple example--from which more applications can be developed.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Priorities</h2>

                    <h2>User Experience + Personalization</h2>
                    <p>
                        Data aggregation comes with data and RPC schemata to generalize data broadcasting and reporting process. Canned report packages come pre-loaded in the application. "Reports" are data filtering and summation processes that get targeted to specific UI elements, with the application coming preloaded with UI elements designed for different types of data manipulation. Apply Bayesian analysis to rank data sources and categories over time, providing the user a more relevant stream.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Data</h2>
                    <p>
                        Communication is two-way, the user body being yet another data source for the system to aggregate. Application provides comprehensive privacy policy to assure users on scope of data collection and usage. Auto-collected data limited to anonymized usage statistics for targeted enhancement. Personalized usage statistics for streamline user preferences stays on user's application instance. Any other data collection is self-elected per user.
                    </p>

                        Collection Core:
                        Custom ETL plugins per data source
                        Custom data and RPC schemata per data source
                        Translating to normalized data stream
                        Persistence
                        Socrata?
                        App Core:
                        Single-page web app, with potential to leverage PhoneGap
                        Normalized data consumer
                        simple map-reduce based report generation
                        UI components to target report outputs
                        ListView
                        Map
                        Calendar
                        Topic-specific data collection forms
                        Analytics tracking
                        Output stream to server (WebSockets?), feedback data
                        Admin Core:
                        system health and activity statistics
                        ???

                        Initially, Collection Core will be sunk into app with App Core. As data correlation becomes necessary, Collection Core can be removed back to a central server.
